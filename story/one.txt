"Who are you?" Erin found herself saying. "Who am I?"

"The answer to that," Sol ran his fingers through his hair, a not-quite-nervous expression on his face. "The answer is not as simple as the question implies."

"I'm standing in a spaceship, and I just passed the rings of Saturn." She grinned. "I think we passed 'simple' just before the asteroid belt".

Sol matched her grin. "Fair. Alright, kiddo..."

"Don't call me kiddo! You're at most like 5 years older than me." Erin interjected, blowing a raspberry.

"Ehhh.. try 50,000."

"What!"

"I told you. It's not a simple answer," Sol laughed. "My name is Solomon. I was born approximately 50,000 years ago."

"That's not possible!" Whatever Erin was expecting to hear, it was definitely not that. "Didn't humanity evolve like 10,000 years ago?"

"No, not- well, I suppose. The humans of this age emerged about 10,000 years ago, that is true."

"This age? What do you mean?"

"Humanity, as you know it, is now in its third age. I was born near the end of the first age."

"You mean there have been two 'ages' of humanity? I can't even imagine what that means"
